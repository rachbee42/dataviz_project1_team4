# Infant Mortality Rate in England and Indices of Deprivation Analysis
Child and infant mortality rates are crucial indicators of a populationâ€™s overall health and well-being, reflecting the effectiveness of healthcare systems, social policies, and economic conditions.
In today's presentation, we aim to delve into the intricate relationship between child and infant mortality rates and various indices of deprivation in England. Through our data analysis, we strive to uncover meaningful insights that can contribute to policy-making, public health initiatives, and the overall well-being of children in England. 
Our findings have the potential to inform targeted interventions and strategies that address the socio-economic determinants of infant mortality rates, aiming for equitable health outcomes across diverse communities.
We look forward to sharing our research findings and highlighting any correlations, disparities, and implications discovered during our analysis.
